# Tokenizer_Parser_JACK
JACK is a primitive form of JAVA with basic syntax. Details of JACK Language have been well explained in nand2tetris.
The tokenizer in this project takes as input a JACK file and converts it into JACK tokens. 
The parser makes  parse tree from those tokens.

Command to run this parser: 

run.py <JACK file path> 

Output: An XML file called MyParsed<filename> in the same folder as the JACK file.
